//standard rules to create our own immutable class

// 1. the class must be final so that subclasses don't override methods
// 2. Make all your fields final, so that theyâ€™re initialized only once inside 
//    the constructor and never modified afterward.
// 3. provide only getter methods. Don't provide setter methods 
//    i.e don't give direct access
// 4. When exposing methods which modify the state of the class, you must always 
//   return a new instance of the class.
// 5. If the class holds a mutable object:
// Inside the constructor, make sure to use a clone copy of the passed argument and never set your 
// mutable field to the real instance passed through constructor, this is to prevent the clients who 
// pass the object from modifying it afterwards.
// Make sure to always return a clone copy of the field and never return the real object instance.

//java classes that are immutable 
// String , Wrapper classes, java.util.Locale, java.util.UUID etc

//advantages 
//thread safe, memory usage, do not need a copy constructor, Performance(SCP)

		this.name = name;

		//deep copy in contructor itself
		Age clone = new Age();
		clone.setYear(age.getYear());
		this.age = clone;

		ImmutableStudent student = new ImmutableStudent("akash",1,age);
		
		System.out.println("student age year = " + student.getAge().getYear());
		
		//1.prone to modify //solution creating a cloned object in constructor
		age.setYear(1990);
		
		//2.prone to modify //solution is returning a cloned object not student's age object
		
		student.getAge().setYear(1993);
